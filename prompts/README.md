# Prompts Directory

This directory contains detailed prompts and documentation for AI-assisted development, code reviews, and feature implementation.

## Purpose

The `prompts/` folder serves as a knowledge base for:
- **System Architecture**: Understanding the codebase structure
- **Feature Implementation**: Guidelines for adding new features
- **Bug Fixing**: Systematic approach to debugging
- **Code Review**: Standards and best practices
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling and optimization strategies

## Usage

### For AI Assistants
Load relevant prompt files to understand:
1. Project context and goals
2. Architectural decisions
3. Implementation patterns
4. Best practices and conventions

### For Developers
Use these prompts as:
- Onboarding documentation
- Reference for design decisions
- Templates for new features
- Debugging workflows

## Best Practices

1. **Keep prompts up-to-date** with code changes
2. **Document all architectural decisions** in system-design.md
3. **Add new prompts** for recurring patterns or complex features
4. **Reference specific files and functions** when explaining concepts
5. **Include code examples** for clarity

## Contributing

When adding new features or making significant changes:
1. Update relevant prompt files
2. Add new prompts for new subsystems
3. Document design decisions and trade-offs
4. Include examples and use cases
