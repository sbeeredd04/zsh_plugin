# Project Overview: Zsh Autocomplete Plugin

## Project Name
**zsh_plugin** - High-Performance Zsh Autocomplete with Ghost Text

## Repository
- **Owner**: sbeeredd04
- **Repository**: zsh_plugin
- **Current Branch**: dev
- **Default Branch**: main

## Mission Statement
Provide a lightning-fast, intelligent shell autocomplete system that learns from user behavior and provides real-time suggestions with minimal overhead.

## Core Features

### 1. Ghost Text Completion
Real-time command suggestions that appear as you type, similar to modern IDEs.

**How it works:**
- Analyzes command prefix
- Queries trie data structure for best match
- Displays suggestion as ghost text (right of cursor)
- User can accept with → (right arrow) or Tab

### 2. Prefix-Filtered History Navigation
Smart history navigation that only shows commands matching your current prefix.

**How it works:**
- Type a prefix (e.g., "git")
- Press ↑/↓ to cycle through only "git*" commands
- Maintains position in filtered results
- Return to original text by cycling past all results

### 3. Persistent Learning
Commands and their usage patterns are stored persistently across sessions.

**How it works:**
- Commands stored in trie with frequency counters
- Timestamp tracking for recency scoring
- Automatic save to `~/.cache/zsh-autocomplete/trie_data.txt`
- No re-initialization overhead on new sessions

### 4. High Performance
Optimized C implementation for speed-critical operations.

**Performance characteristics:**
- **Startup**: 0ms (uses cached data)
- **Ghost text latency**: <5ms for any prefix
- **History filtering**: <10ms for 1000+ commands
- **Memory footprint**: ~1MB for 1000 commands
- **Disk storage**: ~50KB cache for typical usage

## Technology Stack

### Languages
- **C (C11)**: Core autocomplete engine, data structures
- **Zsh**: Plugin integration, key bindings, UI

### Data Structures
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Primary storage for commands
  - O(k) insertion where k = command length
  - O(k) prefix matching
  - Frequency and timestamp metadata per node
- **Dynamic Arrays**: History and filtered results
- **Priority Queue (unused in current version)**: Reserved for future features

### Build System
- **Make**: Build automation
- **GCC**: C compiler (with optimization flags)
- **Debug builds**: With symbols and DEBUG macro

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Data Layer (`src/trie.c`, `include/trie.h`)
- Trie node creation/destruction
- Command insertion and search
- Best completion algorithm
- Frequency tracking

### 2. Storage Layer (`autocomplete.c` - persistence functions)
- Cache directory management (`~/.cache/zsh-autocomplete/`)
- Serialization/deserialization of trie data
- File I/O with error handling

### 3. Processing Layer (`autocomplete.c` - main logic)
- Command-line argument parsing
- Operation dispatch (ghost, history, update, init)
- History filtering
- Ghost text generation

### 4. Interface Layer (`plugin.zsh`)
- Zsh widget definitions
- Key binding management
- Buffer manipulation
- Visual feedback (ghost text rendering)

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Command Completion
```bash
# User types:
$ git st

# Ghost text appears:
$ git st|atus
        ^^^^^ (ghost text in grey)

# User presses → or Tab:
$ git status|
```

### Secondary Use Case: History Navigation
```bash
# User types prefix:
$ git 

# User presses ↑:
$ git push origin main  (from history)

# User presses ↑ again:
$ git commit -m "..."   (previous git command)
```

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Performance First
- C for computation-heavy tasks
- Zsh only for UI/UX
- Minimal IPC overhead
- Efficient data structures

### 2. User Experience
- Non-intrusive suggestions
- Intuitive key bindings
- Fast response times
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Reliability
- Memory safety (proper allocation/deallocation)
- Error handling at every layer
- Fallback to standard behavior on failure
- No crashes or hangs

### 4. Simplicity
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal dependencies (no external libs)
- Self-contained binary
- Easy installation

## Current Limitations & Future Work

### Known Limitations
1. No ghost text coloring (monochrome)
2. Commands with `&&` not treated atomically
3. Left/right arrow keys need default navigation bindings
4. No fuzzy matching (strict prefix only)

### Planned Improvements
1. Default arrow key bindings for character navigation
2. Atomic handling of compound commands
3. Ghost text syntax highlighting
4. Configurable key bindings
5. Plugin configuration file
6. Extended Unicode support

## Success Metrics
- **Response Time**: <10ms for all operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: <2MB for 5000+ commands
- **User Adoption**: Positive feedback on usability
- **Reliability**: Zero crashes in production use
- **Learning Accuracy**: >90% relevant suggestions

## Development Workflow
1. Feature branches from `dev`
2. PR to `dev` for review
3. Merge to `main` for releases
4. Tagged releases with semantic versioning
